# network-utils

This is a set of scripts that setup interesting network configurations when run.

Head on to each script to learn about what it does and how to invoke it.

Here's a little summary:

 - `reset.sh` cleans the running network configuration,
   leaving the system as if the kernel was just booted.

 - `soho.sh` gives DHCP service on an interface of your
   choosing, allowing connected hosts to access the Internet
   through your connection.
